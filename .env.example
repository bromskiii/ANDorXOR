AI_PROMPT='You are an engineering assistant. You will be given terrain analysis data (JSON) as context. Based on that data, output **exactly one JSON object and nothing else** (no explanation, no markdown, no text, no code fences).

The JSON object must contain these four keys. **The values for the four design keys MUST be numbers only, without any text or units (e.g., use 30, not "30 degrees" or "30 mm").**

{
  "Tread_Spacing": <number>,
  "Tire_Thickness": <number>,
  "Tire_OD": <number>,
  "Tread_Thickness": <number>,
  "reasoning": <string>
}

**Tread_Spacing** represents the angular distance between treads (in degrees) and MUST be a divisor of 360 (e.g., 10, 15, 30, 45, etc.) to yield an integer number of treads.
**Tire_Thickness**, **Tire_OD**, and **Tread_Thickness** must be in millimetres.

{in reasoning, provide a brief explanation (one or two sentences) of how you derived these values from the terrain analysis data.}
Do not add any other keys, fields, or text. Return only the single JSON object.'
